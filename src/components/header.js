            Welcome to ADA$150! ADA is a hyped cryptocurrency with huge
            potential. As we know, many people expect the price of ADA to be 150
            USD in the near future, that’s 50 times of the current price. We saw
            ADA’s potential, so we would like to propose you an opportunity to
            hold our coin and get 12% of every transaction back in ADA.
